// GET /api/consensus: Andaaza's data (see lib/consensus.js).
// A visitor never waits for the markets to be read (a full Kalshi read takes about thirty seconds). The last reading is
// served at once and, when it is more than REFRESH old, a new one is read in the background after the answer has gone
// out. Only the very first visit ever, with nothing saved anywhere, waits, and then only for Polymarket and Manifold
// (about three seconds); Kalshi follows in the background.
//
// Built to run untended for years on free tiers:
// - The newest reading lives in this instance's memory; Blob storage is read only when memory has nothing fresh.
// - Blob writes are budgeted: a reading is taken and saved at most every fifteen minutes, and only while someone is
//   looking; Kalshi's index at most every six hours. A screen showing it round the clock all month would need about
//   2,900 writes; if the free allowance runs out, readings carry on from memory and nothing breaks.
// - If Blob is missing, full or failing, the page still works from memory and the edge cache, just with slower first
//   visits. If every source fails, the last good reading keeps being served, and the page says how old it is.
